# Investor Communications Skill

> **Note:** This skill is specific to **investor communications**. For client proposals or other sales communications, adapt the patterns but adjust tone and content accordingly.

## Purpose

## When to Use

- Writing cold outreach to investors
- Crafting warm intro request emails
- Creating investor update emails
- Writing LP communications
- Drafting press/PR summaries

---

## Email Types & Templates

### Type 1: Cold Outreach (Intro Email)

**Goal:** Get a meeting, not close the deal.

**Structure:**
```
Subject: [Specific hook - not generic]

[1 sentence: Why you're reaching out to THIS investor specifically]

[1-2 sentences: What you're building + one compelling proof point]

[1 sentence: The ask - specific and low-friction]

[Sign-off with context on timing if relevant]
```

**Length:** 4-6 sentences max. Investors skim.

**Example:**
```
Subject: Country culture venture studio - $2M ARR, Tim McGraw partnership

Hi [Name],

Saw your investment in [Portfolio Co] - we're building in an adjacent space
and your thesis on creator-led brands resonates with what we're seeing.

Shareability is a venture studio focused on country culture. We package
ventures with A-list talent (Tim McGraw, Kirk Cousins) and have 3 launched
companies doing $2M+ combined ARR with two more in the pipeline.

Would love 20 minutes to share what we're seeing in the space. Free
Thursday or Friday this week?

Best,
[Name]
```

### Type 2: Warm Intro Request

**Goal:** Make it easy for the connector to forward.

**Structure:**
```
[1 sentence: Ask for the intro with specific investor name]

[Forwardable blurb - see format below]

[1 sentence: Why this investor specifically]

[Thank you + offer to draft the intro email]
```

**The Forwardable Blurb (Critical):**
```
---
[Company] is [one-liner description].

[Key traction point]. [Second proof point if strong].

[Founder background in one sentence].

They're raising [amount] for [use of funds].

[Specific reason for interest in this investor].
---
```

### Type 3: Investor Update

**Goal:** Keep investors informed, build relationship for future asks.

**Structure:**
```
Subject: [Company] Update - [Month/Quarter] [Year]

TL;DR:
- [Biggest win]
- [Key metric movement]
- [One challenge/ask]

WINS:
- [Win 1 with context]
- [Win 2 with context]

METRICS:
- [Metric 1]: [Current] (was [Previous], [X]% change)
- [Metric 2]: [Current] (was [Previous], [X]% change)

CHALLENGES:
- [Challenge 1 and what you're doing about it]

ASKS:
- [Specific ask 1 - intro, advice, resource]
- [Specific ask 2]

Looking ahead:
[1-2 sentences on next 30-90 days]

Thanks for your continued support.

## Tone Calibration by Stage

### Pre-Seed / Seed
- Emphasize: Vision, founder-market fit, early signals
- Tone: Ambitious but self-aware, learning-oriented
- Proof points: Customer conversations, waitlist, LOIs, design partners

### Series A
- Emphasize: Product-market fit evidence, repeatable GTM
- Tone: Confident, metrics-driven
- Proof points: Revenue, growth rate, retention, unit economics

### Series B+
- Emphasize: Category leadership, path to large outcome
- Tone: Market leader, building an enduring company
- Proof points: Market share, competitive moat, team scaling

## Subject Line Formulas

Good subject lines are **specific** and create **curiosity** or **relevance**.

### Formulas That Work:
- `[Category] + [Impressive metric]` → "Creator economy platform - 3x growth, $1M ARR"
- `[Founder credential] + [Company]` → "Ex-Stripe PM building [X]"
- `[Mutual connection] intro: [Company]` → "Sarah Chen intro: Shareability"
- `[Specific hook to investor]` → "Your [Portfolio Co] thesis applied to [space]"

### What to Avoid:
- Generic: "Investment Opportunity"
- Hyperbolic: "The Next Uber of X"
- Vague: "Quick question"
- Too long: More than 6-8 words

---

## Length Guidelines

| Communication | Target Length | Max Length |
|---------------|---------------|------------|
| Cold email | 4-6 sentences | 8 sentences |
| Forwardable blurb | 4-5 sentences | 6 sentences |
| Investor update | 300-500 words | 700 words |
| One-pager | 1 page | 1 page (strict) |
| Thank you note | 2-3 sentences | 4 sentences |

**Rule:** If you're not sure if it's too long, it's too long.

---

## CTA Patterns

Always end with a clear, specific ask:

### Meeting Asks:
- "Would love 20 minutes this week if you're open to it."
- "Free for a quick call Thursday or Friday?"
- "Happy to work around your schedule - [Calendly link]"

### Intro Asks:
- "Would you be comfortable making an intro?"
- "Happy to draft something forwardable if helpful."
- "No worries if it's not the right fit - appreciate you considering."

### Information Asks:
- "Would love your take on [specific question]."
- "Any advice on [specific challenge]?"

### Avoid:
- "Let me know your thoughts" (vague)
- "Would love to chat sometime" (no urgency)
- Multiple asks in one email (pick one)

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### The Novel
> "I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to reach out because..."
[500 more words]

**Fix:** Cut the preamble, start with substance.

### The Spray-and-Pray
> "Dear Investor, I'm reaching out to select VCs..."

**Fix:** Personalize or don't send.

### The Feature List
> "Our platform has AI-powered X, blockchain-enabled Y, and ML-driven Z..."

**Fix:** Lead with outcome, not features.

### The Humble Brag
> "We've been fortunate enough to grow to $5M ARR..."

**Fix:** Just state the fact confidently.

### The Desperation Signal
> "We really need to close this round by month-end..."

**Fix:** Create urgency through momentum, not pressure.
