# Pitch Narrative Skill

> **Note:** This skill is optimized for **investor pitch narratives** using the 6-beat arc. For non-investor PitchApps (proposals, strategies, case studies), use `@narrative-strategist` which adapts the structure to fit the content.

## Purpose

Transform raw inputs (transcripts, notes, data) into a structured, compelling pitch narrative that can power multiple output formats (email, PitchApp, deck).

## When to Use

- Processing a founder interview or discovery call transcript
- Structuring a company story for investor communication
- Creating the narrative foundation before any visual work
- Refining an existing pitch that lacks clarity or flow

## The Pitch Arc (6 Beats)

Every compelling pitch follows this structure. Extract and organize content into these beats:

### Beat 1: PROBLEM (Why Now, Why Urgent)

**What to extract:**
- The pain point or gap in the market
- Why this problem matters NOW (timing trigger)
- Who feels this pain most acutely (ICP)
- What the current alternatives are and why they fail

**Quality bar:**
- Specific, not generic ("SMBs struggle with X" → "Restaurant owners lose 12% of revenue to Y")
- Urgent, not theoretical (market timing, regulatory change, technology shift)
- Relatable to investor's mental models

**Red flags:**
- Problem is too broad or vague
- No clear timing trigger
- Solution looking for a problem

### Beat 2: INSIGHT (What They See That Others Don't)

**What to extract:**
- The founder's unique perspective or discovery
- Why they're the ones who saw this
- The "aha moment" or observation that sparked the company
- Contrarian or non-obvious belief

**Quality bar:**
- Specific insight, not generic observation
- Connected to founder's background/experience
- Creates "of course!" reaction when explained

**Red flags:**
- Insight is just "technology is better now"
- No connection to founder's journey
- Competitors clearly have the same insight

### Beat 3: SOLUTION (Product, How It Works)

**What to extract:**
- What they built / are building
- How it works (simple explanation)
- Key differentiators from alternatives
- The "magic" - what makes it 10x better

**Quality bar:**
- Explainable in one sentence
- Clear differentiation (not just "better")
- Defensible advantage (network effects, data, relationships, expertise)

**Red flags:**
- Feature list instead of value proposition
- No clear "why us vs. them"
- Complexity disguised as sophistication

### Beat 4: PROOF (Traction, Metrics, Logos)

**What to extract:**
- Revenue, growth rate, unit economics
- Customer logos / case studies
- Engagement metrics (retention, NPS, usage)
- Partnerships, press, awards
- Team credentials and prior exits

**Quality bar:**
- Metrics that matter for the business model
- Growth trajectory, not just snapshots
- Social proof from recognizable names
- Honest about stage-appropriate metrics

**Red flags:**
- Vanity metrics (downloads without engagement)
- Cherry-picked timeframes
- No customer validation

### Beat 5: TEAM (Why Them)

**What to extract:**
- Founder backgrounds and relevant experience
- Why this team is uniquely suited to solve this problem
- Key hires and advisors
- Prior successes (exits, scaling experience)

**Quality bar:**
- Clear founder-market fit
- Complementary skills across founding team
- Ability to attract talent

**Red flags:**
- No domain expertise
- First-time founders with no relevant experience
- Key roles unfilled with no plan

### Beat 6: ASK (What They Need, What They'll Do With It)

**What to extract:**
- Raise amount and instrument (SAFE, priced round)
- Use of funds (hiring, product, GTM)
- Milestones the capital will unlock
- Timeline and next steps

**Quality bar:**
- Clear, specific use of funds
- Milestones tied to value creation
- Reasonable runway (18-24 months typical)

**Red flags:**
- Vague use of funds ("growth")
- No clear milestones
- Burn doesn't match stage

## Output Format: Narrative Brief

After extracting content, produce a structured brief:

```markdown
# [Company Name] - Narrative Brief

## One-Liner
[Single sentence that captures the essence]

## The Problem
[2-3 sentences on the pain point and why now]

## The Insight
[2-3 sentences on what they see that others don't]

## The Solution
[2-3 sentences on what they built and why it's different]

## The Proof
[Bulleted list of key metrics, logos, traction]

## The Team
[2-3 sentences on why this team]

## The Ask
[What they're raising and what it unlocks]

---

## Key Messages (Headline Options)
1. [Option 1]
2. [Option 2]
3. [Option 3]

## Pull Quotes
> "[Direct quote from transcript that captures founder voice]"
> "[Another compelling quote]"

## Unique Angles
- [What makes this story different from typical pitches in the space]
- [Contrarian elements worth emphasizing]

## Open Questions / Gaps
- [Information missing from transcript that would strengthen the narrative]
```

---

## Tone Guidelines

### Do:
- Be confident but not hyperbolic
- Use specific numbers over vague claims
- Let founder's voice come through in quotes
- Emphasize what's genuinely different
- Acknowledge stage-appropriate limitations honestly

### Don't:
- Use superlatives without proof ("best", "only", "revolutionary")
- Hide weaknesses - reframe them as opportunities
- Make claims that can't be backed up
- Sound like every other pitch deck
- Overuse jargon or buzzwords

---

## Compression Ladder

The narrative should work at multiple lengths:

| Format | Length | What to Include |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| One-liner | 10-15 words | Core value prop |
| Tweet | 280 chars | Problem + solution + hook |
| Email intro | 2-3 paragraphs | Full arc, compressed |
| Narrative brief | 1-2 pages | Full arc with detail |
| PitchApp | 10-15 sections | Full arc with visuals |
| Full deck | 12-20 slides | Full arc with appendix |

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing the narrative brief:

- [ ] Each beat has specific, concrete content (not generic)
- [ ] The problem → insight → solution flow is logical
- [ ] Metrics are stage-appropriate and honest
- [ ] Founder voice is preserved in quotes
- [ ] Unique angles are identified and emphasized
- [ ] Open questions are flagged for follow-up
- [ ] One-liner passes the "would I remember this?" test
- [ ] Tone is confident but not arrogant
