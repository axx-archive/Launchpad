# Pitch Narrative Skill

> **Note:** This skill is optimized for **investor pitch narratives** using the 6-beat arc. For non-investor PitchApps (proposals, strategies, case studies), use `@narrative-strategist` which adapts the structure to fit the content.

## Purpose

Transform raw inputs (transcripts, notes, data) into a structured, compelling pitch narrative that can power multiple output formats (email, PitchApp, deck).

## When to Use

- Processing a founder interview or discovery call transcript
- Structuring a company story for investor communication
- Creating the narrative foundation before any visual work
- Refining an existing pitch that lacks clarity or flow

## The Pitch Arc (6 Beats)

Every compelling pitch follows this structure. Extract and organize content into these beats:

### Beat 1: PROBLEM (Why Now, Why Urgent)

**Emotional target:** The reader should feel *recognition and concern* — "I've seen this problem. It's real, it's growing, and current solutions aren't cutting it."

**What to extract:**
- The pain point or gap in the market
- Why this problem matters NOW (timing trigger)
- Who feels this pain most acutely (ICP)
- What the current alternatives are and why they fail

**Quality bar:**
- Specific, not generic ("SMBs struggle with X" → "Restaurant owners lose 12% of revenue to Y")
- Urgent, not theoretical (market timing, regulatory change, technology shift)
- Relatable to investor's mental models

**Red flags:**
- Problem is too broad or vague
- No clear timing trigger
- Solution looking for a problem

### Beat 2: INSIGHT (What They See That Others Don't)

**Emotional target:** The reader should feel *surprise and reframe* — "I never thought of it that way. That's a genuinely different way to see this."

**What to extract:**
- The founder's unique perspective or discovery
- Why they're the ones who saw this
- The "aha moment" or observation that sparked the company
- Contrarian or non-obvious belief

**Quality bar:**
- Specific insight, not generic observation
- Connected to founder's background/experience
- Creates "of course!" reaction when explained

**Red flags:**
- Insight is just "technology is better now"
- No connection to founder's journey
- Competitors clearly have the same insight

### Beat 3: SOLUTION (Product, How It Works)

**Emotional target:** The reader should feel *excitement and clarity* — "This makes sense. This could actually work. I want to see more."

**What to extract:**
- What they built / are building
- How it works (simple explanation)
- Key differentiators from alternatives
- The "magic" - what makes it 10x better

**Quality bar:**
- Explainable in one sentence
- Clear differentiation (not just "better")
- Defensible advantage (network effects, data, relationships, expertise)

**Red flags:**
- Feature list instead of value proposition
- No clear "why us vs. them"
- Complexity disguised as sophistication

### Beat 4: PROOF (Traction, Metrics, Logos)

**Emotional target:** The reader should feel *confidence and trust* — "This is real, not just theory. They've actually done this."

**What to extract:**
- Revenue, growth rate, unit economics
- Customer logos / case studies
- Engagement metrics (retention, NPS, usage)
- Partnerships, press, awards
- Team credentials and prior exits

**Quality bar:**
- Metrics that matter for the business model
- Growth trajectory, not just snapshots
- Social proof from recognizable names
- Honest about stage-appropriate metrics

**Red flags:**
- Vanity metrics (downloads without engagement)
- Cherry-picked timeframes
- No customer validation

### Beat 5: TEAM (Why Them)

**Emotional target:** The reader should feel *credibility and connection* — "These people can actually do this. I'd want to work with them."

**What to extract:**
- Founder backgrounds and relevant experience
- Why this team is uniquely suited to solve this problem
- Key hires and advisors
- Prior successes (exits, scaling experience)

**Quality bar:**
- Clear founder-market fit
- Complementary skills across founding team
- Ability to attract talent

**Red flags:**
- No domain expertise
- First-time founders with no relevant experience
- Key roles unfilled with no plan

### Beat 6: ASK (What They Need, What They'll Do With It)

**Emotional target:** The reader should feel *urgency and partnership* — "I want to be part of this. The window is now."

**What to extract:**
- Raise amount and instrument (SAFE, priced round)
- Use of funds (hiring, product, GTM)
- Milestones the capital will unlock
- Timeline and next steps

**Quality bar:**
- Clear, specific use of funds
- Milestones tied to value creation
- Reasonable runway (18-24 months typical)

**Red flags:**
- Vague use of funds ("growth")
- No clear milestones
- Burn doesn't match stage

## Use-Case Narrative Guides

The 6-beat arc above is optimized for investor pitches. Other use cases follow different structures:

### Proposal Arc

**Flow:** Context → Their Problem → Our Approach → What You Get → Why This Works → Investment → CTA

Key difference from investor pitch: you're solving THEIR problem, not telling YOUR story. The audience is the hero, not the company. Use partnership language ("we'll build this together"), not sales language ("our platform delivers"). Every section should answer: "What does THIS mean for them?"

### Case Study Arc

**Flow:** Context → Challenge → Approach → Results → Impact → What's Next

Key difference: retrospective and proof-heavy. The story is "what happened," not "what could happen." Lead with specific metrics and outcomes. Name the client (if permitted), the timeline, the constraints. Credibility comes from honesty about what was hard, not just what went well. End with forward momentum — what the results made possible.

### Company / Studio Page Arc

**Flow:** Brand Identity → What We Build → How We Think → CTA

Key difference: no single narrative thread. Each section can stand alone. There's no "problem to solve" — the page is a brand statement, not a persuasion arc. Tone is confident declaration, not argument. Visitors should leave knowing what you do, how you think, and whether they want to work with you. Keep it tight — studio pages that try to tell a story often feel forced.

## Output Format: Narrative Brief

After extracting content, produce a structured brief:

```markdown

## The Solution
[2-3 sentences on what they built and why it's different]

## The Proof
[Bulleted list of key metrics, logos, traction]

## The Team
[2-3 sentences on why this team]

## The Ask

---

## Key Messages (Headline Options)
1. [Option 1]
2. [Option 2]
3. [Option 3]

## Pull Quotes
> "[Direct quote from transcript that captures founder voice]"

## Unique Angles
- [What makes this story different from typical pitches in the space]

## Open Questions / Gaps

```

---

## Tone Guidelines

### Do:
- Be confident but not hyperbolic
- Use specific numbers over vague claims
- Let founder's voice come through in quotes
- Emphasize what's genuinely different
- Acknowledge stage-appropriate limitations honestly

### Don't:
- Use superlatives without proof ("best", "only", "revolutionary")
- Hide weaknesses - reframe them as opportunities
- Make claims that can't be backed up
- Sound like every other pitch deck
- Overuse jargon or buzzwords

---

## Compression Ladder

The narrative should work at multiple lengths:

| Format | Length | What to Include |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| One-liner | 10-15 words | Core value prop |
| Tweet | 280 chars | Problem + solution + hook |
| Email intro | 2-3 paragraphs | Full arc, compressed |
| Narrative brief | 1-2 pages | Full arc with detail |
| PitchApp | 10-15 sections | Full arc with visuals |
| Full deck | 12-20 slides | Full arc with appendix |

---

- [ ] Founder voice is preserved in quotes
- [ ] Unique angles are identified and emphasized
