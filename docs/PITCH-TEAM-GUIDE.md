# Your AI Pitch Team: A Guide for Founders

## What Is This?

You have access to an AI-powered pitch team that transforms your conversations into polished investor materials. Think of it like having a small agency on call -- a strategist to shape your story, a copywriter to craft the words, and a project manager to keep everything moving.

This guide explains who's on the team, what they do, and how the whole process works.

---

## The Big Picture

**What goes in:** A recorded conversation or notes about your company -- the messy, unstructured version of your story.

**What comes out:** A complete pitch package:
- A structured narrative brief (the foundation)
- Investor email drafts (ready to send)
- PitchApp section copy (for your scroll-driven pitch site)
- Slide content (for a traditional deck)

The magic is in the transformation. You talk naturally about your company, and the team shapes it into materials that follow proven investor communication patterns.

## Meet the Team

### The Narrative Strategist

**Real-world equivalent:** A communications consultant or pitch coach

**What they do:** The Narrative Strategist listens to your conversation and finds the story. They're trained to identify the six elements that make investors pay attention:

1. **The Problem** -- What pain exists and why it matters now
2. **The Insight** -- What you see that others don't
3. **The Solution** -- What you built and why it's different
4. **The Proof** -- Traction, metrics, and evidence it's working
5. **The Team** -- Why you're the ones to win
6. **The Ask** -- What you need and what it unlocks

They take your raw conversation and organize it into a "narrative brief" -- a structured document that becomes the foundation for everything else.

**Their output:** A narrative brief that captures your story in a clear, compelling structure

### The Copywriter

**Real-world equivalent:** A marketing writer who specializes in investor communications

**What they do:** Once the Narrative Strategist creates your foundation, the Copywriter transforms it into polished, format-specific content. They know that:

- Investor emails need to be 4-6 sentences max (investors skim)
- PitchApp headlines need to work on their own (people scroll)
- Slide content needs to be readable from across a room

They create multiple versions so you have options, and they adapt the tone based on whether you're doing cold outreach, asking for a warm intro, or sending updates to existing investors.

**Their outputs:**
- 2-3 investor email drafts with different angles
- Section-by-section copy for your PitchApp
- Slide headlines and bullet points for a traditional deck

---

### The Pipeline Manager

**Real-world equivalent:** A project manager or producer

**What they do:** The Pipeline Manager coordinates the whole process. They make sure:

- Work happens in the right order (you can't write emails before the story is clear)
- You approve each stage before moving forward
- All the files end up in the right places
- Nothing falls through the cracks

They're the one who keeps asking "Is this approved? Can we move forward?"

**Their output:** A complete, organized pitch package with everything in its proper place

## The Playbooks

Each team member follows a "playbook" -- a set of guidelines that encode best practices from successful investor communications.

### The Pitch Narrative Playbook

This defines the "6-beat pitch arc" -- the structure that makes investor pitches compelling:

| Beat | Question It Answers |
|------|---------------------|
| Problem | Why does this matter? Why now? |
| Insight | What do you see that others don't? |
| Solution | What did you build? Why is it better? |
| Proof | Is it working? Who's using it? |
| Team | Why will you win? |
| Ask | What do you need? What will you do with it? |

The playbook also includes quality standards -- what makes each beat strong vs. weak. For example, a strong "Problem" is specific ("Restaurant owners lose 12% of revenue to...") not vague ("SMBs struggle with efficiency").

### The Investor Communications Playbook

This covers the craft of writing to investors:

- **Email structure:** How to write cold outreach, warm intro requests, and investor updates
- **Subject lines:** What makes investors open vs. delete
- **Length guidelines:** Emails should be 4-6 sentences; updates should be 300-500 words
- **Tone calibration:** How to sound at different stages (pre-seed = ambitious but learning; Series A = confident and metrics-driven)
- **Common mistakes:** What to avoid (the Novel, the Spray-and-Pray, the Humble Brag)

## How the Workflow Flows

Here's what happens from start to finish:

### Phase 1: Extract the Story

```
You provide: Transcript or notes about your company
           |
           v
Narrative Strategist reads everything and creates a narrative brief
           |
           v
You review and approve (or give feedback for revision)
```

**Checkpoint:** The narrative brief must be approved before moving forward. This is the foundation -- if it's wrong, everything built on it will be wrong.

### Phase 2: Write the Copy

```
Approved narrative brief
           |
           v
Copywriter creates investor emails, PitchApp copy, slide content
           |
           v
You review and approve (or give feedback for revision)
```

**Checkpoint:** Copy must be approved before building the actual PitchApp.

### Phase 3: Build the PitchApp (Optional)

```
Approved copy
           |
           v
Developer builds the scroll-driven pitch website
           |
           v
QA reviews the visual output
           |
           v
You review and approve
```

### Phase 4: Delivery

Everything gets packaged up in an organized folder structure:

```
tasks/yourcompany/
  - transcript.txt      (your original input)
  - narrative.md        (the structured story)
  - investor-email.md   (email drafts)
  - pitchapp-copy.md    (website section copy)
  - slides.md           (deck content)

apps/yourcompany/       (if PitchApp was built)
  - index.html
  - css/style.css
  - js/app.js
  - images/
```

## What You Get at the End

### 1. Narrative Brief

A 1-2 page document that captures your company story in a structured format. Includes:
- One-liner that captures your essence
- Each of the 6 beats, written clearly
- 3 headline options (different angles on your story)
- Pull quotes from your conversation (your authentic voice)
- Notes on what makes your story unique
- Gaps flagged (what information would strengthen the pitch)

### 2. Investor Email Drafts

2-3 versions you can use or adapt:
- **Cold outreach:** For investors you don't know
- **Warm intro request:** For when you have a mutual connection
- **Forwardable blurb:** A snippet your connectors can copy-paste

Each includes subject line options and notes on how to personalize for different investor types.

### 3. PitchApp Copy

Section-by-section content for a scroll-driven pitch website:
- Headlines for each section
- Body copy where needed
- Words to emphasize (for visual highlighting)
- Suggestions for animation and visual treatment

### 4. Slide Content

For a traditional pitch deck:
- Headline for each slide
- Bullet points (kept minimal)
- Suggested visuals
- Speaker notes (what to say when presenting)

## A Few Things to Know

### The Process Has Checkpoints

You approve at each stage before moving forward. This isn't just bureaucracy -- it's because each stage builds on the last. If the narrative is off, the emails will be off. If the emails are off, the PitchApp will be off.

### Feedback Is Expected

The first draft is rarely perfect. The team is built to iterate. Common feedback looks like:
- "This doesn't capture what's special about us"
- "The problem isn't framed right"
- "Can we try a different angle?"
- "Too formal / too casual"

Just say what's not working, and the team will revise.

### Garbage In, Garbage Out

The quality of the output depends on the quality of the input. A rich, detailed conversation about your company produces better materials than thin notes. If the team flags "gaps" in the narrative brief, consider providing more information before proceeding.

### Your Voice Matters

The team preserves direct quotes from your conversation. Your authentic voice is an asset -- investors want to hear from founders, not marketing copy. The goal is to structure and polish your story, not replace it with generic investor-speak.

## Getting Started

To kick off the process, provide:

1. **Company name**
2. **Transcript or notes** -- the more detail, the better
3. **Any existing materials** -- website, old deck, data room links
4. **Target investors** -- what stage? what thesis? any specific names?
5. **Timeline** -- when do you need these materials?

The Pipeline Manager will take it from there.
