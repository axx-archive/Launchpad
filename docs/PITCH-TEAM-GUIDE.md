# Your PitchApp: A Guide for Clients

## What Is a PitchApp?

A PitchApp is an interactive, scroll-driven presentation — a modern alternative to sending a PDF or slide deck. Instead of flipping through static slides, your audience scrolls through a cinematic, full-screen experience with smooth animations and a clear story arc.

It's a URL you share. They open it, scroll through it, and walk away understanding your story. No downloads, no attachments, no "let me walk you through this."

## How It Works

### 1. You Submit Your Project

You start by submitting your project through Launchpad. Tell us about your company, upload any existing materials (decks, one-pagers, transcripts), and describe what you need. The more context you provide, the better the result.

**Status: Requested**

### 2. You Review the Story Arc

Before we build anything, we extract the story from your materials and present it as a narrative — the section-by-section arc that will drive your PitchApp. You'll see this as a set of story cards in Launchpad.

You can approve it, give notes via Scout, or ask for a different direction. We don't start building until you're happy with the story.

**Status: Narrative Review**

### 3. We Build Your PitchApp

Once the narrative is approved, our team builds a custom PitchApp from scratch. We write the copy, design the sections, and build the interactive experience.

**Status: In Progress**

### 4. You Review with Scout

When your PitchApp is ready, you'll get a notification. Open it in Launchpad and review it alongside Scout — your AI review assistant.

Scout can help you:
- Walk through each section and explain the choices made
- Suggest copy changes (tone, wording, emphasis)
- Flag anything that feels off
- Submit edit requests on your behalf

Just talk to Scout like you'd talk to a colleague. "Can we make the headline punchier?" or "This section doesn't capture what's special about us" — Scout gets it.

**Status: Review**

### 5. We Revise Based on Your Feedback

Your edit requests come back to our team. We make the changes and push an updated version. You'll get notified when the revision is ready.

This cycle can repeat as many times as needed until you're happy.

**Status: Revision → Review**

### 6. Your PitchApp Goes Live

Once you approve the final version, your PitchApp goes live at a permanent URL. Share it anywhere — email, LinkedIn, text message. It works on desktop, tablet, and mobile.

**Status: Live**

## Tips for Great Feedback

The best PitchApps come from clear, specific feedback. Here's what helps:

**Be specific:** "The third section feels too long" is more useful than "something feels off."

**Focus on the story:** Does it capture what makes you special? Does the flow make sense? Would your audience get it?

**Trust the format:** PitchApps are designed for scrolling, not flipping. Short, punchy sections work better than dense paragraphs.

**Share context:** If something doesn't feel right, tell us why. "Our investors care most about traction, so that section should come earlier" helps us make smarter choices.

**Don't worry about the tech:** You don't need to know HTML or animation. Just focus on the content and how it feels. We handle the rest.
