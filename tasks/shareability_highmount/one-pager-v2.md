## The World as We See It

Two shifts are reshaping sports, entertainment, and media.

**YouTube is now cultural infrastructure.**

Every major league, every creator ecosystem, every celebrity podcast or venture connects back to YouTube. Not as a distribution channel — as the operating system for cultural relevance. The groups who understand this at a granular level are compounding. Everyone else is guessing.

**American culture is shifting inward.**

For decades, it was shaped from the coasts. That's over. The energy now rises from the middle — Texas, Tennessee, the heartland. Country music's dominance. Taylor Sheridan's empire. The cultural reach of Rogan and Theo Von. This isn't a moment. It's a structural reordering.

We built Shareability at the intersection of both.

## What We've Built

**The Shareability Platform**

We're the company YouTube hires to do YouTube.

We sit inside the boardrooms and algorithm conversations. We architect Google's Influence Center of Excellence. We built YouTube's Global Influence Measurement frameworks. When YouTube needs to execute their most important cultural initiatives — the Olympics, NFL, Formula 1, PGA, Taylor Swift, Roblox, the Grammys — they bring us in.

In 2026, our partner scope inside Google is expanding significantly.

**The Celebrity Venture Engine**

A repeatable system for packaging, funding, and launching celebrity-led ventures from Middle America.

In 2023, we partnered with Tim McGraw and David Ellison to launch Down Home. In the first year: $100M+ in projects for 2026 production — Netflix series, Paramount feature, Broadway musical, and Music City Rodeo (now the largest rodeo east of the Mississippi).

That success opened the pipeline. We now have top-tier talent approaching us to build their own ventures — across media, digital, and experiential.

**Current pipeline:**

| Project | Raise | Timing |
|---------|-------|--------|
| Red Coach (Kirk Herbstreit) | $10M | Q1 2026 |
| Day Off Golf | $10M | Q1/Q2 2026 |
| One Night in Nashville | $150M | Q1/Q2 2026 |
| The Roast of Country Music | $5M | Q1/Q2 2026 |

Paramount and Paramount Sports are part of our relationship infrastructure — not an asset to acquire, but access that flows through partnership.

## Who We Want to Be

We've learned that the real value is in the intelligence and architecture — not the execution grind.

We want to keep the brain. We want to partner with operators who can be the hands.

The Shareability Platform becomes an intelligence layer that powers ecosystems bigger than what we could build alone. The Venture Engine becomes a packaging system with strategic partners who can accelerate deal flow, deployment, and scale.

We're not looking to be acquired and absorbed. We're looking for partners who see the same world we do and want to build in it together.

## What We're Raising

**For the Venture Engine:** We're raising capital to scale the packaging system and fund the current pipeline. The model is carry-style economics — partners participate in the upside of deals that flow through the engine.

**For the Platform:** We're open to strategic investment or acquisition of the Shareability Platform by the right partner — one who can deploy the intelligence infrastructure across a broader ecosystem than we can reach independently.

These can be separate conversations or one integrated structure. We're open to co-architecting.

## The Ask

We're talking to a small number of groups who operate at the intersection of sports, creators, and media.

If you see the same shifts we do, let's talk about what we could build together.
