# SHAREABILITY × HIGHMOUNT

**Intelligence + Venture — Pre-Read for Discussion**

---

## Two Shifts That Matter

**YouTube is now cultural infrastructure.**
Every major league, creator ecosystem, and celebrity venture connects back to YouTube's distribution mechanics. The groups who understand this at a granular level are pulling away. The groups who don't are operating blind.

**American culture is shifting inward.**
For decades, it was shaped from the coasts. Now the energy is rising from Texas and Tennessee — country music's dominance, Taylor Sheridan's blockbusters, Theo Von and Rogan's cultural reach. This isn't a trend. It's structural.

**Shareability sits at the intersection of both.**

## The Shareability Platform

*YouTube-first intelligence + cultural influence infrastructure*

**Shareability is the company YouTube hires to do YouTube.**

We're in the boardrooms and algorithm conversations — deeply integrated into YouTube's internal ecosystem, data, and platform mechanics.

| What We Do | Proof |
|------------|-------|
| Platform intelligence | Architects of Google's Influence Center of Excellence |
| Cultural insights / trend analysis | Builders of YouTube's Global Influence Measurement frameworks |
| Creator ecosystem strategy | Lead strategy for Olympics, NFL, F1, PGA, Taylor Swift, Roblox, Grammys |
| Algorithmic performance frameworks | Partner scope inside Google expanding significantly in 2026 |
| Activation + distribution for major IP | |

**Strategic direction:** We believe the platform's highest function is as an intelligence layer — not an execution agency. We want to keep the brain and partner with operators who can be the hands.

## The Celebrity Venture Engine

*A repeatable system for packaging, funding, and launching celebrity-led ventures from Middle America*

**Thesis:** Build, finance, and scale media, brands, and experiences from the "inside out" — filling the cultural and economic gaps overlooked by coastal media.

### Proof It Works: Down Home

Partnered with **Tim McGraw** and Skydance CEO **David Ellison** to launch Down Home (2023).

**Results in first year:**
- **$100M+** in projects closing for 2026 production
- Netflix scripted series
- Paramount feature film
- Broadway country musical (creators of Rock of Ages)
- Music City Rodeo — now the largest rodeo east of the Mississippi

### Current Pipeline

| Project | Lead | Raise | Timing |
|---------|------|-------|--------|
| **Red Coach** | Kirk Herbstreit | $10M | Q1 2026 |
| **Day Off Golf** | TBD | $10M | Q1/Q2 2026 |
| **One Night in Nashville** | TBD | $150M | Q1/Q2 2026 |
| **The Roast of Country Music** | TBD | $5M | Q1/Q2 2026 |

**Red Coach:** Entertainment company with Kirk Herbstreit. Mission: first-class content and experiences championing the promise of sports. Already launched *Nonstop* podcast; *Out of the Pocket* studio podcast launching March 2026 alongside film, TV, digital, and live event slate.

### Why This Works

- Exclusive early access to major celebrity IP
- In-house packaging: concept → commercialization
- Cultural credibility in Middle American markets
- **Paramount and Paramount Sports** partnership in pipeline

## What This Means for Highmount

Dude Perfect is one of the most successful creator ecosystems in the world. The question is what compounds it.

| With the Platform | With the Venture Engine |
|-------------------|------------------------|
| Audience growth systems you own | Structured access to celebrity IP pipeline |
| Creator network expansion playbooks | Packaging capabilities |
| Channel strategy + distribution architecture | Paramount positioning |
| The intelligence layer YouTube relies on | Carry-style economics on deal flow |

**This isn't about hiring an agency. It's about integrating infrastructure.**

## Structure Options

We've had interest from several groups. We're weighing: keep Shareability as the hub of our own venture engine, or partner with a strategic ecosystem where we can scale beyond what we can do independently.

**Path A: Strategic Transaction**
Acquire or control the Shareability Platform. Own the intelligence infrastructure. Preferred partnership keeps us connected as needed.

**Path B: Venture Engine Investment**
Invest in the packaging and venture group. Your capital and operating ecosystem scale the deal flow. Includes preferred Platform access.

**Blended option available.** Ideally, a lead partner engages on both.

Looking forward to the conversation.
