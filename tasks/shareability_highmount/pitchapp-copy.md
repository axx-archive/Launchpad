## Color System (CSS Variables)

```css
:root {
    --color-bg:           #0a0a0a;
    --color-bg-card:      #141414;
    --color-bg-raised:    #1a1a1a;
    --color-text:         #f0ede8;
    --color-text-muted:   #9a9388;
    --color-accent:       #c8a44e;    /* Gold - primary */
    --color-accent-light: #d4b65e;
    --color-accent-dim:   #a08040;
    --color-accent-alt:   #5b7fb5;    /* Blue - secondary for Platform sections */
    --color-negative:     #8b3a3a;
}
```

**Usage guidance:**
- Gold (`--color-accent`) for Venture Engine, investment, closing sections
- Blue (`--color-accent-alt`) for Platform, intelligence, data sections
- Can differentiate Asset 1 (Platform = blue) from Asset 2 (Venture = gold) visually

## Copy Tone Notes

- **Confident but not aggressive** — partnership language, not sales pitch
- **Specific over generic** — YouTube, McGraw, Paramount are named, not described abstractly
- **Honest about structure** — "Two clean paths" acknowledges optionality
- **Highmount-aware** — Dude Perfect reference, "what you're building" framing
