# Shareability × Highmount — Slide Deck Content

Target: 10-12 slides for investor presentation

---

## Slide 1: Title

**Headline:** Shareability
**Subtitle:** Intelligence + Venture
**Subtext:** For Highmount

**Visual:** Dark background, gold accent, clean typography

**Speaker Notes:**
Thank you for taking the time. What I'm going to show you is how Shareability is structured as two linked assets—an intelligence platform and a venture engine—and why we believe Highmount is the ideal partner to accelerate both.

---

## Slide 2: The Opportunity

**Headline:** YouTube Is the Cultural Epicenter

**Bullets:**
- Sports and entertainment have converged on YouTube
- Winners understand platform mechanics at a granular level
- Most organizations operate blind—no intelligence, no systems, no repeatable playbooks

**Visual:** YouTube ecosystem diagram or cultural moment collage

**Speaker Notes:**
YouTube isn't just a distribution channel anymore. It's where culture gets made. The gap between organizations that "get YouTube" and those that don't is widening fast. This is the opportunity we're addressing.

---

## Slide 3: Who We Are

**Headline:** The Company YouTube Hires to Do YouTube

**Bullets:**
- Platform proximity—we help shape how YouTube builds major initiatives
- Not consultants advising from outside; we're inside the relationship
- Multi-year partnerships with YouTube's most important cultural moments

**Visual:** YouTube partnership illustration or abstract platform connection graphic

**Speaker Notes:**
This is the positioning that matters. When YouTube needs to execute their biggest cultural initiatives—Olympics, NFL, Taylor Swift—they bring us in. We're not pitching from the outside. We're inside the room where these things get built.

---

## Slide 4: Track Record

**Headline:** YouTube's Most Important Cultural Initiatives

**Logos/Cards:**
- Olympics
- NFL
- Formula 1
- PGA
- Taylor Swift
- Roblox
- Grammys

**Subtext:** These aren't client logos. YouTube brought us in to execute.

**Visual:** Logo grid or initiative card layout

**Speaker Notes:**
I want to be clear about what these represent. These aren't clients who hired us. These are initiatives where YouTube specifically brought us in because they needed our capabilities. That's a fundamentally different relationship.

---

## Slide 5: Two Linked Assets

**Headline:** Platform + Venture Engine

**Two columns:**

| Asset 1: Shareability Platform | Asset 2: Venture Engine |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------|
| YouTube-first intelligence | Packaging system |
| Strategy infrastructure | Talent → investable opportunities |
| Performance architecture | Content, experiences, brands |
| Audience growth systems | Pipeline of celebrity IP deals |

**Visual:** Two interconnected boxes or overlapping circles

**Speaker Notes:**
Here's how we're structured. Two assets that feed each other. The Platform is the intelligence and architecture layer. The Venture Engine is the packaging system that turns our talent relationships into investable opportunities.

---

## Slide 6: Asset 1 — The Platform

**Headline:** Intelligence, Not Execution

**Bullets:**
- Trend intelligence that YouTube itself relies on
- Channel strategy and creator network expansion
- Distribution playbooks and performance architecture
- Audience growth systems

**Key message:** We're getting out of the execution game. We want to keep the intelligence and partner with best-in-class operators for execution.

**Visual:** Dashboard or data visualization mockup

**Speaker Notes:**
This is the strategic shift we're making. The real value is in the intelligence layer, not in being an agency that grinds on execution. We want to own the brain and partner with operators who can be the hands. That's where Highmount comes in.

---

## Slide 7: Asset 2 — The Venture Engine

**Headline:** From Talent Access to Investable Opportunities

**Bullets:**
- Takes talent relationships and structures them into deal flow
- Packages concepts through to commercialization
- Creates pipeline of celebrity IP opportunities
- Proof point: Tim McGraw and Down Home

**Visual:** Deal flow diagram or talent-to-venture pipeline illustration

**Speaker Notes:**
The Venture Engine is the packaging capability. We have relationships with top-tier talent. The question is: how do you turn access into equity? Tim McGraw and Down Home proved we can do this. Now we have more talent coming to us looking for the same thing.

---

## Slide 8: Proof It Works

**Headline:** Tim McGraw. Down Home.

**Content:**
- Built and launched successfully
- Demonstrated the packaging system works
- Now: more top-level talent approaching after McGraw success
- Paramount relationship activated in the pipeline

**Visual:** Down Home branding or country music visual (if rights allow)

**Speaker Notes:**
Down Home isn't a pitch. It already happened. That's the proof the system works. And the result is we now have a pipeline of talent who saw what we did with Tim and want their own version. That includes our developing relationship with Paramount.

---

## Slide 9: The Highmount Fit

**Headline:** Intelligence + Execution

**Two columns:**

| Shareability | Highmount |
|--------------|-----------|
| Intelligence + Architecture | Execution + Scale |
| Platform proximity | Operator ecosystem |
| Packaging capability | Dude Perfect network |
| Deal flow | Deployment capacity |

**Key message:** You're building exactly the kind of ecosystem our intelligence can materially accelerate.

**Visual:** Partnership/handshake visual or overlapping Venn diagram

**Speaker Notes:**
This is why we're here. Highmount and the Dude Perfect ecosystem are positioned as exactly the kind of execution partner we want to feed. You have the operators, the audience, the infrastructure. We have the intelligence and the deal flow. Together, this becomes a flywheel.

---

## Slide 10: Two Clean Paths

**Headline:** How We Can Work Together

**Option A: Strategic Transaction**
- Acquire or take controlling stake in Shareability Platform
- Own the intelligence infrastructure outright
- Preferred partnership keeps our team connected

**Option B: Venture Engine Investment**
- Invest directly into the packaging and venture group
- Capital participation in the pipeline
- Carry-style economics, structured deal flow access

**Visual:** Two-path diagram

**Speaker Notes:**
We're offering two clean paths. Path A is strategic—you acquire or control the Platform and own the intelligence layer. Path B is venture—you invest in the packaging engine and get economics on the deal flow. Either one unlocks the flywheel. The question is which structure fits your strategy better.

---

## Slide 11: What This Unlocks

**Headline:** For Highmount

**Bullets:**
- Audience growth systems
- Channel strategy infrastructure
- Creator network expansion playbooks
- Distribution architecture
- Structured deal flow
- Paramount pipeline access
- Carry-style venture participation

**Closing line:** A flywheel that compounds what you're already building.

**Visual:** Flywheel or growth momentum graphic

**Speaker Notes:**
Here's the concrete list of what you get access to. Not as a service you rent, but as infrastructure you own or have preferred access to. This isn't about hiring an agency. It's about integrating capabilities that accelerate your entire ecosystem.

---

## Slide 12: Closing

**Headline:** Shareability
**Subtitle:** Intelligence + Venture
**Tagline:** Two linked assets. One accelerated future.

**Contact info:** [To be added]

**Visual:** Clean, echo of title slide

**Speaker Notes:**
That's the opportunity. Two assets designed to compound what Highmount is building. We're excited about what we could build together. What questions do you have?

## Appendix Slides (If Needed)

### A1: Paramount Relationship

**Headline:** Paramount Pipeline Access

**Content:**
- Paramount and Paramount Sports are part of our pipeline
- Not an acquisition target—a relationship asset
- Becomes preferred access through our deal flow

**Speaker Notes:**
The Paramount relationship is worth understanding. It's not something we're selling. It's access that comes through being in our pipeline. If you're our partner, you get preferential positioning on opportunities that flow through that relationship.
