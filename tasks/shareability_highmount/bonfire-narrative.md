# Bonfire Narrative Brief

## The Arc: From Watching Culture to Building With It

---

### Origin: The Outside-In Era

Shareability was built on a simple insight: culture moves through the internet before it moves anywhere else.

We became YouTube pioneers. Then Google's trend intelligence group. We built the operating system that helps the world's biggest brands understand what's about to matter—before it matters.

For a decade, that meant watching culture flow from the coasts inward. Hollywood to heartland. Outside in.

### The Signal: Something Shifted

Then something changed.

Tim McGraw's team reached out. Not for content strategy. For ventures.

When we looked at the data, we saw what they were feeling: unprecedented momentum around country culture. Not nostalgia. Not a moment. A structural shift in where American attention was moving.

The culture was flowing the other way now. Middle America outward. Inside out.

---

### The Proof: Down Home

We didn't theorize. We built.

With McGraw and David Ellison, we launched Down Home—a multi-platform entertainment company rooted in authentic Middle American storytelling.

The result: $100M+ in projects across Netflix, Paramount, Broadway, and experiential ventures including Music City Rodeo.

Down Home proved the thesis. It also proved something else: the talent in this market wants real partners, not tourists.

### The Studio: Bonfire

Success attracted more talent. They came to us.

Bonfire is the celebrity venture studio built for this moment—where Middle American cultural momentum meets world-class venture execution.

**What we bring:**

1. **Deep market intelligence.** Shareability's signal-detection capability, now focused on the fastest-growing cultural economy in America.

2. **Best-in-class packaging.** We structure ventures that talent actually wants to build—not licensing deals dressed up as partnerships.

3. **Execution partners who deliver.** Digital through Shareability. Film and TV through Paramount. Experiential through proven operators like Etzel and Nashville Co.

4. **An actionable slate.** One Night in Nashville. Red Coach. The Roast of Country Music. Fully Loaded Fridays. These aren't concepts—they're in motion.

**The talent pipeline:** Bert Kreischer. Josh Allen. Megan Moroney. Riley Green. Caitlin Clark. Jelly Roll.

Names that would have seemed unlikely five years ago. Inevitable now.

### The Opportunity

Middle America isn't an underserved market. It's the market that's been waiting for builders who actually understand it.

We spent a decade learning to see where culture is going.

Now we're building there.

## Gut-Check

**What works:**
- The "outside in → inside out" frame is clean and memorable. It positions Shareability's pivot as strategic foresight, not opportunism.
- Down Home as proof is strong—$100M+ in projects is credible and specific.
- "Partners, not tourists" is a sharp differentiation without being defensive.
- The structure moves naturally: origin → signal → proof → studio → opportunity.

**What I'd pressure-test:**
- The "inside out" language might need one more beat of explanation for investors who haven't lived this shift. Consider whether "from the middle outward" lands better in a live pitch.
- The talent list at the end is strong but could raise the question: "Are these signed or aspirational?" The deck should clarify.
- "Fastest-growing cultural economy in America" is a bold claim. Make sure there's a stat to back it if challenged.

**Tone calibration:**
- Reads confident without being breathless. The proof does the selling, not the adjectives.
- Might be slightly too restrained for some investors who want more explicit "why now" urgency. But for sophisticated capital, restraint reads as confidence.

**Length check:**
- ~450 words. Readable in under 2 minutes. On target.
