## Images to Use
All 21 exported images are in `/Users/ajhart/Desktop/PitchApp/tasks/shb-slides/`. These should be copied to `/Users/ajhart/Desktop/PitchApp/apps/shareability/images/` and renamed to match the Shareability naming convention.

## Key Differences from ONIN
1. **Narrative structure:** ONIN is a venue pitch (location, show, team, financials). Shareability is a company evolution story (three eras, tension, reset, new model).
2. **More text-centric:** Several slides are pure text with no background image (slides 5, 9, 11, 12, 14, 19).
3. **Comparison/table layout:** Slide 6 has a structured comparison table not seen in ONIN.
4. **Multi-step process:** Slides 13-16 show a 6-step process that should animate as one section.
5. **Two-tier card gallery:** Slide 18 has "Launched" vs "In the Works" categories with different card styles (solid vs dashed borders).
6. **Blue accent color:** Intelligence/EXIT branding uses steel blue, creating a secondary accent beyond gold.
