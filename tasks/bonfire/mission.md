## Notes

Looking to use this pitch deck as is, turn it into a website, and have animations come up as you scroll, optionally with clicks or hovers. The animations in the deck are simple, just click to make stuff appear along the way. Fonts used are Inter 18 for the meat of things, and Walkway for the neon style. I like the font size in this deck. I also have a larger power point deck you can pull images from. The images in the pdf are compressed so use the power point for better quality. Or ask me for specific images you need.
