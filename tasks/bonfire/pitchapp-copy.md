# PitchApp Section Copy — Bonfire: One Night in Nashville

## Meta
- **Title:** One Night in Nashville — Bonfire
- **Subtitle:** The proven ABBA Voyage model, rebuilt for country music on the Las Vegas Strip.
- **OG Description:** A 3,000-seat country spectacle and entertainment district on the Strip, from the production team behind ABBA Voyage. $168M projected Year 1 revenue.

## Hero Type Recommendation
**Type:** Cinematic Photo
**Rationale:** This is a spectacle-first brand selling a feeling before a financial model — a moody, neon-lit Nashville stage shot sets the emotional stakes before a single number lands.

---

## Section 1: Hero — One Night in Nashville
**Intent:** The first frame should feel like the opening shot of a concert film — electric, warm, unmistakably Nashville. Not corporate. Not Vegas-slick. The feeling of walking into a honky-tonk where something extraordinary is about to happen.
- **Title:** One Night in Nashville
- **Tagline:** Where eras collide on the Las Vegas Strip.
- **Scroll prompt:** "Scroll"

---

## Section 2: Text-Centered — The Precedent
**Intent:** Establish that this isn't speculative. A near-identical model already prints money — and the numbers are better than anyone assumes.
- **Label:** "THE PRECEDENT"
- **Headline:** ABBA Voyage generates <em>$135M a year</em> from a parking lot outside London.

---

## Section 3: Numbered Grid — The Gap
**Intent:** Show that ABBA Voyage succeeded *despite* obvious constraints — and that those constraints are precisely the opportunity Bonfire is built to capture.
- **Label:** "WHAT ABBA LEFT ON THE TABLE"
- **Items:**
  - **01** — <strong>60 minutes outside London.</strong> Not walkable, not impulsive. Every ticket is a planned trip.
  - **02** — <strong>One restaurant on-site.</strong> 3,500 people arrive nightly with nowhere to eat, drink, or stay.
  - **03** — <strong>10:30pm curfew.</strong> The show ends and the venue goes dark. No second act.
  - **04** — <strong>No surrounding district.</strong> No retail, no nightlife, no revenue beyond the ticket itself.

---

## Section 4: Background Stats — Why Country, Why Now
**Intent:** Anchor the genre bet in data. Country isn't a nostalgia play — it's the fastest-moving audience in American music, and the spending proves it.
- **Label:** "THE MARKET"
- **Headline:** Country is the fastest-growing major genre in America.
- **Stats:**
  - `data-count="3" data-suffix="x"` — Faster growth than any other U.S. music genre
  - `data-count="17" data-suffix="M+"` — Annual visitors to Nashville
  - `data-count="10" data-prefix="$" data-suffix="BN+"` — Nashville tourism spending per year
- **Callout pills:** "Largest U.S. radio format" · "Fastest-growing streaming category" · "80M+ monthly Spotify listeners"

---

## Section 5: Background Statement — The Spectacle
**Intent:** This is the emotional peak of the scroll. Stop selling. Let the reader feel the show. Everything before this built the case; this section is the reason people will actually come.
- **Label:** "THE SHOW"
- **Title:** *Where eras collide and legends return to their prime.*
- **Subtitle:** Performances that cannot happen anywhere else — every single night.
- **Description:** Johnny Cash trading verses with Luke Combs. Lainey Wilson duetting with Shania Twain in her prime. Dolly Parton, Waylon Jennings, Garth Brooks — not as nostalgia, not as tribute. Lifelike performers sharing a 3,000-seat stage with today's biggest stars. The duets the world never got to see.

---

## Section 6: Card Gallery — The Impossible Duets
**Intent:** Make the roster tangible. These aren't hypothetical pairings — they're the reason someone tells a friend, "You have to see this."
- **Headline:** Johnny Cash × Luke Combs. Dolly × Post Malone. <em>Duets the world never got</em> — nightly.
- **Description:** ILM's spectral technology places legends at their peak alongside today's biggest stars. Full-stage, lifelike performances — not holograms, not projections. The technology runs live, in real time, 365 nights a year.
- **Cards:**
  1. **Image direction:** Johnny Cash in black, stark stage lighting, mid-song intensity. **Label:** "Johnny Cash × Luke Combs"
  2. **Image direction:** Dolly Parton, rhinestones catching warm spotlight, peak-era glamour. **Label:** "Dolly Parton × Post Malone"
  3. **Image direction:** Shania Twain, arena-scale energy, leopard print era. **Label:** "Shania Twain × Lainey Wilson"
  4. **Image direction:** Waylon Jennings, outlaw grit, smoky stage haze. **Label:** "Waylon Jennings × Jelly Roll"
  5. **Image direction:** Garth Brooks silhouette, cowboy hat backlit by stadium floods. **Label:** "Garth Brooks × Morgan Wallen"

---

## Section 7: Split Image+Text — Powered by ILM
**Intent:** Credibility transfer. ILM isn't consulting — they're building the show. Same team that already proved this works at scale, nightly, for paying audiences.
- **Label:** "THE TECHNOLOGY"
- **Headline:** Built by <em>Industrial Light & Magic.</em>
- **Description:** The same team that created ABBA Voyage — and the visual effects behind Avatar, The Mandalorian, and Star Wars — is building One Night in Nashville. Their spectral performance technology is the only system on earth proven at this scale, nightly, for a paying audience.
- **Sub-description:** Not holograms. Not deepfakes. Full-stage cinematic performances rendered in real time.
- **Image direction:** ILM production environment — large dark studio, motion-capture rigs, banks of monitors showing rendered performers mid-performance. Should feel like NASA mission control meets a film stage. Technical, precise, awe-inspiring.

---

## Section 8: Metric Grid — The Venue
**Intent:** Establish physical scale. This is a purpose-built production environment, not a converted theater or temporary installation.
- **Label:** "THE VENUE"
- **Metrics:**
  1. **Value:** 3,000 — **Description:** Purpose-built seats. Close enough to see every expression, big enough to sell out nightly.
  2. **Value:** 360° — **Description:** Screens wrap the entire stage. Every seat faces the performance — no bad angles, no dead zones.
  3. **Value:** 365 — **Description:** Nights a year. No touring schedule. No offseason. One show, perfected and repeated.
- **Summary:** Designed from the ground up for spectral technology — not retrofitted, not shared, not temporary. A permanent home for a permanent show.

---

## Section 9: Dual Panel — Little Broadway
**Intent:** Show the revenue multiplier that ABBA never had. The district turns a 90-minute show into a full-day destination and captures every dollar around the ticket.
- **Panel 1:**
  - **Headline:** Family-friendly by day.
  - **Image direction:** Bright, sun-drenched western streetscape — families walking past honky-tonk storefronts, kids in cowboy boots, live acoustic set on a patio, western retail signage. Nashville's Broadway energy in clean Vegas daylight.
- **Panel 2:**
  - **Headline:** Rowdy country party at night.
  - **Image direction:** Neon-soaked street after dark — packed honky-tonks with open doors, live bands visible through windows, crowd energy spilling onto the sidewalk, cowboy hats and boots under electric signage. Full volume.

---

## Section 10: Split Image+Text — The Location
**Intent:** Remove any doubt about site quality. This isn't off-Strip, "near" the action, or a special trip. It's the dead center of the highest foot traffic in American entertainment.
- **Label:** "THE SITE"
- **Headline:** Center of the <em>Las Vegas Strip.</em>
- **Description:** Between MGM Grand and Aria. Over 50 million pedestrians walk past this site every year. One Night in Nashville isn't a destination you drive to — it's a place you walk past.
- **Sub-description:** Little Broadway fills the full corridor surrounding the venue — Nashville honky-tonks, western retail, live music stages — capturing foot traffic from dawn to well past midnight.
- **Image direction:** Clean, high-altitude aerial of the Las Vegas Strip, daytime for clarity. Site position marked between MGM Grand and Aria with minimal, elegant labels. Pedestrian flow suggested with subtle directional indicators. Geography tells the story.

---

## Section 11: Split Image+Text — Curated by ERNEST
**Intent:** Creative credibility. ERNEST isn't an advisor — he wrote the songs that define this era of country music. He's curating every pairing, every setlist, every moment.
- **Label:** "THE CURATOR"
- **Headline:** The songwriter behind <em>modern country.</em>
- **Description:** ERNEST wrote the songs defining country music right now — Morgan Wallen, Jelly Roll, Lainey Wilson, Tim McGraw, Luke Combs, Post Malone's country record. He isn't advising on the music. He shaped it. He's curating every setlist, every pairing, every moment that hits the stage.
- **Sub-description:** ACM Songwriter of the Year. BMI Country Songwriter of the Year. Over 20 #1 country hits.
- **Image direction:** ERNEST in a candid, confident portrait — Nashville writing room or backstage setting. Warm natural light. Guitar nearby but not posed with it. Should feel like a songwriter at work, not a celebrity at a shoot.

---

## Section 12: Team Grid — The Team
**Intent:** Show the operators behind the vision. Each name carries a specific, relevant track record — not broad credentials.
- **Label:** "WHO'S BUILDING THIS"
- **Headline:** Vegas spectacles, 9-figure raises, and <em>country's biggest tours.</em>
- **Cards:**
  1. **Name:** Russell Geyser / **Role:** CEO, Bonfire — Entertainment & development
  2. **Name:** Dan Charney / **Role:** President — Finance & capital markets
  3. **Name:** Tim Staples / **Role:** Chief Creative Officer — Brand & audience strategy

---

## Section 13: Background Stats — The Returns
**Intent:** Deliver the financial case with clarity and force. The math should feel like a natural conclusion to everything above, not a surprise pivot to spreadsheets.
- **Label:** "THE FINANCIALS"
- **Headline:** $168M in Year 1 revenue. Two ways to invest.
- **Stats:**
  - `data-count="168" data-prefix="$" data-suffix="M"` — Projected Year 1 total revenue
  - `data-count="58" data-suffix="%"` — Annual gross return on land-lease structure
  - `data-count="90" data-prefix="~$" data-suffix="M"` — Net distributable to investors, Year 1
- **Callout pills:** "Land Lease: $154.5M equity" · "Land Ownership: $267M equity" · "32% gross return on owned-land structure"

---

## Section 14: Summary — In Summary
**Intent:** Lock the narrative. Each block should work as a standalone reason to invest. Together they form the complete case.
- **Label:** "IN SUMMARY"
- **Blocks:**
  1. **The model is proven.** ABBA Voyage generates $135M/year from a remote venue with no amenities and a 10:30pm curfew. The format fills seats even when everything around it doesn't.
  2. **Country music is growing 3x faster than any other U.S. genre.** Nashville draws 17M visitors annually and generates $10BN+ in tourism spending. The audience is loyal and ready to spend.
  3. **The show is the hook.** Impossible duets — legends in their prime sharing the stage with today's biggest stars. Performances people will talk about and come back for.
  4. **The district captures what ABBA never could.** Little Broadway wraps the venue in honky-tonks, retail, and nightlife — turning a 90-minute show into a full-day, all-night destination.
  5. **The team has already done this.** ILM builds the show. ERNEST curates the music. Same production technology, same creative caliber, fewer constraints, better location.
  6. **$168M Year 1 revenue.** 58% gross return on land-lease structure. 32% on owned-land structure. Two capital paths for different investor profiles.

## Section 15: Closing — One Night in Nashville
**Intent:** Echo the hero. Leave the reader with the same energy they started with — but now they know the numbers behind the feeling.
- **Title:** One Night in Nashville
- **Tagline:** Where eras collide on the Las Vegas Strip.
- **CTA:** "Back to Top"

## Image Suggestions

| Section | Direction |
|---------|-----------|
| **1 — Hero** | Cinematic wide shot: a Nashville-style neon-lit stage or honky-tonk exterior at night. Warm amber, deep red, and gold tones. Cowboy hat silhouettes in a crowd. Stage glow cutting through atmospheric haze. Should feel like the opening frame of a concert film — electric, aspirational, unmistakably country. NOT kitschy, NOT Vegas-generic. Think concert photography meets movie poster. |
| **5 — Background Statement** | Dark, atmospheric concert crowd — silhouettes with hands raised, dramatic stage backlight cutting through haze. Warm amber tones. Could be real concert photography or high-end concept art of the One Night in Nashville stage interior. The image should evoke awe and scale without revealing too much detail — the imagination does the work. |
| **6 — Card Gallery** | Stylized artist portraits, each era-appropriate. Johnny Cash: stark, dark, high-contrast. Dolly Parton: warm spotlight on rhinestones, peak glamour. Shania Twain: arena energy, confident, leopard-print era. Waylon Jennings: outlaw grit, smoky. Garth Brooks: wide silhouette, cowboy hat backlit. All should share consistent framing (shoulders-up, dramatic directional lighting) so they feel like a curated gallery, not a random collection. |
| **7 — Split (ILM)** | Behind-the-scenes production: large dark studio space, motion-capture rig with performer in suit, banks of monitors showing real-time rendered performers on a virtual stage. Technical crew in the background. Should communicate serious engineering and filmmaking craft — NASA mission control meets soundstage. No flashy VFX — just the machinery that makes the magic. |
| **9 — Dual Panel** | Two views of the same Little Broadway streetscape. **Left (Day):** bright, sun-lit, families, acoustic music on a patio, western retail storefronts with warm wood and painted signage. Clean, welcoming, Nashville-meets-Vegas daytime warmth. **Right (Night):** same street transformed — neon signage ablaze, packed honky-tonk doorways, live bands visible inside, crowd energy, cowboy hats under electric glow. The contrast should be dramatic and instant. |
| **10 — Split (Location)** | Clean, high-altitude aerial of the Las Vegas Strip, shot in daylight for maximum legibility. The site is marked between MGM Grand and Aria with a simple, elegant indicator — no cluttered annotations. Key landmarks labeled minimally. The point is geographic authority: anyone who has been to Vegas immediately understands this location. |
| **11 — Split (ERNEST)** | Candid portrait: Nashville writing room or backstage hallway. Natural, warm light. ERNEST in his element — comfortable, confident, not performing for the camera. Guitar case or notebook nearby. Styled authentic to who he is — not over-produced. The image should say "this is the person who actually writes the songs." |
| **12 — Team Grid** | Professional headshots on dark backgrounds with slight warm tone. Consistent framing and lighting across all three. Business-appropriate but not stiff corporate — these are entertainment operators, not bankers. Slight warmth in the color grade to match the overall brand palette. |
| **13 — Background Stats** | Abstract or atmospheric: could be a blurred, dark stage shot with warm bokeh lights, or a subtle overhead aerial of the Strip at night with the site position faintly glowing. The image should recede behind the numbers — this section is about data, not photography. Dark enough to ensure stat readability. |
