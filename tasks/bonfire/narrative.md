# One Night in Nashville — Narrative Brief

## One-Liner
The ABBA Voyage model — $135M/year from a parking lot outside London — rebuilt for country music, on the Las Vegas Strip, wrapped in the entertainment district ABBA never had.

## The Story

ABBA Voyage was supposed to be a gimmick. Instead it became a cash machine — $135M+ in annual revenue, built for $175M, running nightly in a purpose-built arena. But here's the thing about that arena: it sits in a parking lot an hour outside London. One restaurant. Closes at 10:30pm. Audiences show up, watch the show, and leave. Even with all that money left on the table, the venue fills every night. The model works — and it's barely trying.

Bonfire looked at those numbers and asked the obvious question nobody else was acting on: *What happens when you put this in the right place, for the right audience, at the right time?*

Country music is the answer to all three. The genre is growing 3x faster than any other in the U.S. Nashville pulls 17M+ visitors and $10BN+ in tourism every year. And the technology is no longer theoretical — Industrial Light & Magic, the same team that built ABBA Voyage, is building this show.

But the show itself is what makes this more than a smart real estate play. One Night in Nashville is a 3,000-seat spectacle where the eras of country music collide on one stage. Johnny Cash trading verses with Luke Combs. Lainey Wilson duetting with Shania Twain in her prime. Dolly Parton, Waylon Jennings, Garth Brooks — not as nostalgia acts, but as lifelike performers sharing a stage with today's biggest stars. Performances that are impossible anywhere else, happening every single night. That's the thing people will talk about. That's the reason they'll come back.

Around that venue sits Little Broadway — a full country entertainment district on the Las Vegas Strip, between MGM Grand and Aria, with 50M+ walkers passing by every year. Nashville honky-tonks, western retail, live music. Family-friendly by day, rowdy country party at night. The show sells the tickets. The district captures every dollar around them. The financial model projects $168M in Year 1 total revenue, with ~$90M available to split — a 58% annual gross return on the land-lease structure. ABBA proved the model in the worst possible location. This is the same model, same production team, better genre, better site, with a full revenue capture layer ABBA never built.

## Key Beats

- **The Precedent** — ABBA Voyage: $135M/year, $175M build, remote location, minimal amenities, still sells out nightly. The format works even when everything around it doesn't. *(Target: Recognition — "I've heard of this, but I didn't know the numbers were that good")*

- **The Gap** — ABBA's structural weaknesses: hour outside London, one restaurant, 10:30 curfew, no surrounding entertainment. Revenue is strong *despite* massive leakage. *(Target: Opportunity — "There's clearly more here")*

- **The Timing** — Country is the fastest-growing major genre in American music. The audience is massive, loyal, and spending. Nashville tourism alone is a $10BN+ annual market. *(Target: Conviction — "The demand is real and growing")*

- **The Spectacle** — This is the emotional peak. Eras collide. Legends return to their prime. Impossible duets happen nightly. The audience isn't watching a tribute show — they're seeing something that can't exist anywhere else. *(Target: Excitement — "I need to see this")*

- **The District** — Little Broadway wraps the venue in an all-day, all-night country entertainment experience: honky-tonks, retail, nightlife. The show is the anchor; the district is the multiplier. *(Target: Scale — "This is bigger than I expected")*

- **The Location** — Center of the Las Vegas Strip. Between MGM Grand and Aria. 50M+ foot traffic annually. Not a destination you drive to — a place you walk past. *(Target: Confidence — "The site is real")*

- **The Team & Technology** — ILM builds the show (same team as ABBA Voyage). ERNEST curates it (songwriter behind Morgan Wallen, Jelly Roll, Lainey Wilson, Tim McGraw, Luke Combs). The leadership team brings entertainment, finance, and development experience. *(Target: Credibility — "These people can pull this off")*

- **The Returns** — $168M Year 1 revenue. 58% gross return (land lease) or 32% gross return (land ownership). Two capital structures for different investor profiles. *(Target: Urgency — "The math works, and I want in")*

## Strongest Proof Point

ABBA Voyage generates $135M+ per year from a purpose-built venue an hour outside London, with one restaurant, closing at 10:30pm. Built for $175M. Runs as a nightly cash machine. One Night in Nashville uses the identical production team (ILM), applies the model to a genre growing 3x faster, places it at the center of the Las Vegas Strip, and surrounds it with a full entertainment district. The comparison isn't aspirational — it's structural. Same technology, same team, fewer constraints.

## Pull Quotes

> "Where eras collide and legends return to their prime."

> "Imagine Luke Combs trading verses with Johnny Cash, or Lainey Wilson duetting with Shania Twain in her prime."

> "No one has done this in Country Music."

## Unique Angles

- **The impossible duets are the hook.** Not a hologram concert. Not a tribute show. Performances that literally cannot happen anywhere else — living artists sharing a stage with legends in their prime. That's what people will tell their friends about.
- **ABBA Voyage is the proof, not the peer.** Same production team fixing the original model's specific weaknesses: wrong location, wrong genre momentum, no surrounding revenue capture.
- **The district is the financial multiplier.** Little Broadway turns a 90-minute show into a full-day destination. ABBA proved you can fill a venue with the show alone; this captures the hours before and after.
- **ERNEST is an overlooked credibility signal.** He wrote the biggest country hits of the last five years — Wallen, Jelly Roll, Wilson, McGraw, Combs, Post Malone. He's not advising on the music. He shaped it.
- **Two capital structures** (land lease at $154.5M equity / land ownership at $267M equity) show flexibility and financial sophistication for different investor profiles.

## Open Questions / Gaps

- **Ticket revenue assumptions need specifics.** The model shows $140M in Year 1 ticket revenue from a 3,000-seat venue. At 300 shows/year and 85% occupancy, that implies ~$183 average ticket price. What are the assumed show frequency, occupancy rate, and price tiers? This is the first thing a serious investor will pressure-test.
- **ILM relationship status.** Is there a signed agreement with Industrial Light & Magic? This is the most load-bearing credibility claim in the pitch. "Powered by ILM" needs to be contractual, not conversational.
- **Site control.** Is there a signed lease or LOI for the Strip location? The aerial labels it "Future Site" — investors will want to know what that means in legal terms.
- **Talent agreements.** "Potential talent" is an honest label but a risk flag. Even one confirmed artist (or estate agreement for a legacy act) would meaningfully change investor confidence.
- **Tim McGraw's role.** His photo anchors the "Who We Are" slide and the Down Home connection. Is he an equity partner? Creative advisor? Active participant? His name carries real weight if the involvement is defined.
- **Construction timeline.** No projected timeline from groundbreaking to first show. Investors at this capital level will want to know when revenue starts.
- **Corporate entity clarity.** Is the raise through Bonfire? Geyser Holdings? Down Home? The relationship between these entities isn't clear in the materials.

## Gut-Check

**Is this the real story?** Yes. The narrative runs on a single, strong spine: a proven model with obvious limitations, applied with better ingredients to a hotter market. The ABBA comparison does the heavy lifting, and the impossible duets provide the emotional hook that makes this more than a financial pitch. If ILM and the site are locked, this story is very strong. If either is aspirational, the spine weakens.

**What's the one thing someone will remember?** ABBA Voyage makes $135M a year from a parking lot outside London with one restaurant. These people are doing the country version on the Las Vegas Strip with a whole entertainment district around it.

**What's still weak?** The pitch is built on three pillars that are all presented as future-tense: ILM is building it, the Strip site is secured, major artists are involved. None of these are confirmed in the materials. The narrative is doing its job — the story is clear, the arc builds, the proof point hits. But the underlying deal needs at least one of those pillars locked before sophisticated investors will move. The narrative brief should make that clear to the client without hedging the story itself.

**Confidence level:** 8/10
